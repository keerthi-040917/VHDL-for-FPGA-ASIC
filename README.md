This repository contains projects and hands-on assignments from the Udemy course "Introduction to VHDL for FPGA and ASIC Design" by Scott Dickson.

The course provides a solid foundation in VHDL, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. As I progress through the material, Iâ€™ll be documenting each assignment I complete, along with simulation results, explanations, and potential improvements.

These projects are helping me build a strong understanding of digital design principles, hardware description languages, and the workflow for FPGA/ASIC development.# VHDL-for-FPGA-ASIC
